KBot - Base Telegram Bot
KBot is a base template for building Telegram bots using Python and the python-telegram-bot library. This bot provides a starting point for creating custom bots that can perform a variety of functions based on user input.

Requirements
Python 3.x
python-telegram-bot library
Setup
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/kbot.git
Install the python-telegram-bot library: pip install python-telegram-bot
Create a new Telegram bot by talking to the BotFather.
Replace the BOT_TOKEN in the config.py file with the token provided by the BotFather.
Run the bot by executing the bot.py file: python bot.py
Usage
Once the bot is running, it will respond to commands sent by users via Telegram. By default, the bot responds to the following commands:

/start - Starts the bot and displays a welcome message.
/help - Displays a help message with information on how to use the bot.
/echo <text> - Echoes back the text sent by the user.
These commands can be modified or new commands can be added by editing the bot.py file.
